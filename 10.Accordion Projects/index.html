            Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for
            documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
            content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
            technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages
            such as JavaScript.

            the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup
            language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime
            environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
            Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript
            code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript
            to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and
            core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites
            use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web browsers
            have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
